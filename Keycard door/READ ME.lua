	Insertion:
	
	I've put everything into folders so that you know where to put everything.
	It's simple, if you see a folder named "Workspace", that means you have to put what's inside in Workspace.
	If you see a folder named "ReplicatedStorage", you put what's inside in ReplicatedStorage, etc.
	
	NOTE: DO NOT move the whole folder, just what's inside of it. After you're done, you can delete this folder.
	
	
	Modifying:
	
	If you want to adjust anything, I've put a list of settings called "Constants" in my scripts, you can find them in:
	- Workspace -> KeycardDoorWall -> DoorFrame -> Script
	- StarterGui -> DoorGui -> DoorNotifier
	
	NOTE: If you want to modify the door, you can do whatever you want with everything except the DoorFrame
	(Workspace -> KeycardDoorWall -> DoorFrame). If you know what you're doing, you can also remake the door entirely,
	just make sure that it has all the parts with non-default names (so anything named Part, Model, etc. can be
	omitted entirely). You don't have to use the same parts, just make sure you have parts that correspond to them
	with their names.
